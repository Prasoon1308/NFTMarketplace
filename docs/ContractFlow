## Contract Flow

On deploying the contract, the address of the deployer will be saved in _contractOwner_. The contract owner can give access to an address for minting new NFTs using `setArtist` function.

To access some of the set/change functions of the contract, access can be given to _moderator_ using the `setModerator` function. By default the contract owner will also get the moderator access. This function is used to implement the idea of multisig wallet usage for some of the functions later. 

The address with access can use the `mintNFT` function to mint new NFTs ( bunch or single)

The contract owner has to give acccess to an address to approve the transaction on its behalf using the `approve` function. 

The contract owner can also set the time of start of the presale and the duration of presale using the `updatePresaleTime` function.

For the value of _ _saleActivity_ from the function `saleActivity` as true, the buyer can use the `presale` function to buy the newly minted NFTs. The buyer has to send the amount of _presalePrice_ to buy the NFT.

To resell an NFT, the owner has to list the NFT open for sell using the function `listNFTForSale` with new reselling price. Freshly minted NFTs cannot be listed for this. 

The interested buyers can buy the NFT using the `resell` function (if the address has an approval for the transaction). The buyer can view the amount that has to be sent by viewing the `salePrices` mapping for that _ _tokenId_.
