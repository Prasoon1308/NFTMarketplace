On deploying the contract, the address of the deployer will be saved in _contractOwner_. The contract owner can give access to an address for minting new NFTs using `setArtist` function.

The address with access can use the `mintNFT` function to mint new NFTs ( bunch or single)

The contract owner can also set the time of start of the presale using the `updatePresaleTime` function.
