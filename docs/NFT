Basic Notes

*_ERC721A Implementation_*: To optimize gas costs and allow batch minting and transfers, we'll be using the ERC721A standard. Incorporate this extension of the ERC721 standard into the contract to enable minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction.
*_Categor_y*: Two categories: Premium and Normal. Use an enum to represent the categories, and make sure to store the category information with each NFT and take the category at time of minting only.
*_Pricing_*: The price of NFTs will be category-dependent. To implement this, create a mapping or an array to store the fixed prices for each category. When users purchase an NFT, the contract should automatically determine the price based on its category. Also add update option for category to be called by multisig or owner only.
*_Presale_*: During the presale period (presale period will be set by admin), NFTs will be available at a discounted price compared to the original sale price. Implement the presale mechanism by applying a percentage discount on the original price. The contract should handle presale purchases separately from regular sales. (Percentage upto 2 decimal value)
*_Commission Rate and Royalty_*: Define variables to store the commission rate and royalty percentages. When a user purchases an NFT, the contract should calculate the commission and royalty amounts and distribute the funds accordingly to the designated addresses. (Also add options to update commission and royalty percentages)
*_Record Keeping_*: Keep track of all transactions within the contract. Create mappings or arrays to store essential information, including NFT owners, sale prices, commissions, royalties, etc. This will help us maintain transparency and accountability within the marketplace.
*_Bunch Listing and Transfer_*: Implement the ERC721A batch transfer function to enable users to transfer multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This will significantly reduce gas costs and enhance the user experience.
*_Mode of payment_*: Both native tokens and coins. Currently focusing on payment by ether only.
