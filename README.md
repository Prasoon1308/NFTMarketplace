## Contract Flow

On deploying the contract, the address of the deployer will be saved in Owner. The commission fees and a normal presale duration will be set at the deployment of the contract. The contract owner can give access to an address for minting new NFTs using `setArtist` function. By default the contract owner will also get the moderator access.

To access some of the set/change functions of the contract, access can be given to moderator using the `setModerator` function. By default the contract owner will also get the moderator access. This function is used to implement the idea of multisig wallet usage for some of the functions later. 

The address with artist access can use the `mintNFT` function to mint new NFTs ( bunch or single)

The moderators can also reset the time of start of the presale and the duration of presale using the `updatePresaleTime` function. Also the discount for the presale can be set using setPresaleDiscount function by the moderator only.

The buyer can use the `presale` function to buy the newly minted NFTs. The buyer has to send the amount of presalePrice (which is discounted price, can be retrieved by knowing presaleDiscount) to buy the NFT.

To resell an NFT, the owner has to list the NFT open for sale using the function `listNFTForSale` with new salePrice. Freshly minted NFTs are already all for sale if they are not sold in presale. 

The interested buyers can buy the NFT using the `sale` function. The buyer can view the amount that has to be sent by viewing the `salePrices` mapping for that tokenId.

Moderator has access to functions : changeCommissionFees, setArtist, setBaseURI, updatePresaleTime
(Only the contract owner can use this function)
setArtist(address _artist) -  to set a new artist address.
Artist has access to functions : setTokenPricebyCategory, mint
(Only moderator address can use this function)
setBaseURI(string calldata baseURI) - to set the base URI for tokens.
(Only moderator address can use this function)
changeCommissionFees(uint256 newCommissionFees) - to change the commission fees.
(Only moderator address can use this function)
setTokenPricebyCategory(Category category, uint256 categoryPrice) - to set the price per token category. Takes enum value (0 for premium, 1 for normal) and the respective price
	(Only artist address can use this function)
mint(uint256 quantity, uint256 fees, Category batchCategory, string[] memory _tokenURIs) - to mint new tokens. Takes quantity, royalty fees, enum value(for category) and the respective tokenURI values
(Only artist address can use this function and the length of array should match the quantity specified)
setPresaleDiscount(uint256 _presaleDiscount) - to set the presale discount percentage.

presale(uint256 tokenId) - to participate in the presale of a token by buying it at a discounted price. The buyer needs to  send the presale price which is the category token price - discount.
(Can only be used during the presale period, and only the freshly minted token must be available for sale)
